Watcher, (C) 2012 Mauro Riccardi

Watcher is a GPL program, written in javascript for node.js.
To use it to send your games live via ftp to a relay server, you must
    a) use xboard/winboard, with option '-serverMoves=<filename>'
    b) copy the 'watcher/' folder wherever you prefer
    c) either install node.js on your system, or copy the node executable into watcher's main folder
    d) either install node-ftp module for node.js on your node.js installation, or copy node-ftp source 
       into a subfolder 'watcher/node-ftp/' of the program's main folder:
       you can obtain node-ftp from https://github.com/mscdex/node-ftp
    e) edit your watcher.ini file to reflect the details of your system. See below for details.
    f) issue command 'node watcher.js' from folder 'watcher/'
    g) start xboard with the option '-serverMoves=<filename>': don't forget to specify the same name with the correct path into 'watcher.ini' file

Configuration file 'watcher.ini':
    This file is a simple text file, with a fixed format: each line has to be
    
    <token> : <value>\n
    
    where <token> is any combination of lowercase alphabetic characters plus underscores ('_'),
    while <value> is any combination of digits, letters, underscores, '\', ' ', '.', '-', starting with
    a letter, a digit, or an underscore.
    In case this helps you, the program matches each line using the following regular expression:
    
        ([a-z_]+)\s*:\s*([\w\/\\][\w:\\ .\-]+)
    
    where you can see that there is an undetermined  number of spaces between the token and the column,
    and between the column and the value.
    Admissable tokens are at present (any other token will be ignored):
    
        username            the username of your ftp connection
        password            the password "    "   "       "
        movesfilename       the name (with path) of the file generated by xboard (the path should be the 
                            path of xboard executable, while the name of the file is passed by the user
                            to the GUI via argument of '-serverMoves' option: at the moment this option
                            is undocumented in xboard, but something might appear into xboard docs in the
                            future)
        remotefilename      the name of the file you want to write the pgn to, on the remote ftp server
        hostname            the hostname of the ftp server
        delay               the time interval (in msec) the program will wait before polling for new moves:
                            keep in mind that if the file hasn't changed, nothing will be sent via ftp
