As for now this is just a dumb server, answering at every GET req with the content of xboard generated serverMoves file
2012-04-06
This version of the program should be a daemon repeatedly checking (after some delay) the file xboard generates, then if it changed since last time, it parses the file, make it a PGN, and sends it via ftp to Luca's server
2012-04-07
Everything has been implemented in parser, even disambiguation of rare things like several like-coloured bishops, and such.
Also reading options from .ini has been implemented.
